# CSGO-Market-Comparison
This repository contains a Python script that allows you to compare prices of items from different CS:GO trading platforms. The script takes data from different trading platforms, calculates the potential profit after subtracting the sales fee on each platform, and provides a comparison between trading platforms based on a certain profit threshold **(entered by the user)**.

### Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Required Python libraries: requests, pandas, itertools, os.

### Usage
**1)** Choose the desired option:
**Option 1 - Download data and compare**: This option fetches data from various marketplaces **(CS.DEALS, ShadowPay, SKINPORT, Skinwallet)**, calculates the potential profit after deducting the selling fee on each platform, and provides a comparison between marketplaces based on the specified profit threshold.

**Option 2 - Compare - WITHOUT downloading**: This option assumes that you have already downloaded the data from the marketplaces and saved them as CSV files in the **sites_download** folder. It directly compares the existing data without making additional API requests.

**The results from all comparisons will be saved in the RESULTS.csv file, and each individual comparison between sites will be stored in CSV files in the sites_results folder.**

### Profit Calculation
The script takes into account the selling fee on each marketplace when calculating the potential profit. For each item, the profit is calculated as follows:

**Profit = Price after selling - Purchase Price - Selling Fee**

Please note that the selling fee varies on each platform and is deducted from the selling price to determine the actual profit.

### CSV Format
The **CSV** files generated by the script use **"@"** as the delimiter. This is because some skin names contain spaces or commas, which can cause issues when using these characters as delimiters. By using **"@"** as the delimiter, we ensure that the **CSV** files are properly formatted and the data is correctly parsed.

For example, a CSV record may look like this:
```css
M4A1-S | Basilisk@23.45@22.98
```
Where:

Column 1: Skin name (**M4A1-S | Basilisk**)
Column 2: Price on the marketplace (**$23.45**)
Column 3: Price after selling (considering fees) (**$22.98**)
_Please note that **"@"** is chosen as the delimiter to minimize conflicts with the data content._

### Configuration
To use the ShadowPay and Skinwallet APIs, you need to obtain your API tokens and replace the placeholders in the script:

```python
# Replace 'YOUR_SHADOWPAY_TOKEN' with your ShadowPay token
headers = {'Token': 'YOUR_SHADOWPAY_TOKEN'}

# Replace 'YOUR_SKINWALLET_COOKIE' and 'YOUR_SKINWALLET_TOKEN' with your Skinwallet credentials
headers = {
    'cookie': 'YOUR_SKINWALLET_COOKIE',
    'accept': 'application/json',
    'x-auth-token': 'YOUR_SKINWALLET_TOKEN'
}
```

### Note
Please make sure to use this script responsibly and respect the terms and conditions of the marketplaces you are accessing. Be aware that excessive API requests or unauthorized access may lead to restrictions.
